# Artiseeker

### About

Artiseeker is a web tool that displays your Genshin Impact characters in an animated build card. I am currently in the process of remaking this project to be more responsive, easier to use, better designed, more client-side focused, and better structured overall.

This project was originally created when I was a beginner and just wanted to make something cool. However, it has alot of flaws as it doesnâ€™t work on Linux and is generally poorly made. As a result, the current version is broken.

**Note:** This project is currently non-functional. I recommend checking out my Hexenzirkel repository, which is the remake of this project. On another note, Artiseeker is prob the first Genshin card tool that was almost entirely built with PHP, which I think is pretty cool.
